# Coding Assessment L-2 Code Submission Process with Boilerplate

Welcome to the coding assessment l2. We are excited to see your skills in action. Please follow the instructions below to submit your solution.

## Getting Started

1. HTML File (index.html):
  Document Structure:
  The HTML file serves as the foundation of the webpage, providing the structure and content hierarchy.
  It begins with a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, specifying the HTML version being used.
  The <html> tag encloses the entire document, indicating the start of the HTML content.
  Metadata:
  Metadata within the <head> section includes essential information about the document, such as character encoding (`
  UTF-8`), viewport settings for responsiveness, and links to external resources like stylesheets and fonts.

  Content:
  Within the <body> element, the HTML file contains the visible content of the webpage.
  This includes a container (`
  <div class="product-container">`) for product details and images, organized into sections such as product images, details, colors, sizes, quantity, and description.
  Styling and Script Links:
  The HTML file links to external resources (style.css and script.js) to apply styles and add interactivity.
  Stylesheets (`
  <link>` tags) are included to import CSS rules from an external file (`style.css`), enhancing the visual presentation of the webpage.
    - Similarly, the JavaScript file (`script.js`) is linked at the end of the `<body>` to ensure that the DOM (Document Object Model) is fully loaded before executing any JavaScript code.
2. CSS File (style.css):
  Reset Styles:
  The CSS file begins with a set of reset styles (* {}) to normalize the default browser styles across different browsers.
  This helps create a consistent starting point for styling the webpage.
  Layout and Design:
  CSS rules are defined to control the layout, positioning, sizing, spacing, colors, typography, and other visual aspects of the webpage.
  Specific styles are applied to elements such as product images, details, prices, colors, sizes, buttons, and quantity inputs to achieve the desired design.
  Responsive Design:
  Media queries (@media) are utilized to make the webpage responsive to various screen sizes and devices.
  Different sets of styles are defined for specific screen widths, ensuring that the webpage adapts its layout and appearance accordingly for optimal viewing across devices.
3. JavaScript File (script.js):
  Data Fetching:
  The JavaScript file uses the Fetch API to retrieve data from an external JSON file (data.json).
  This data likely contains information about the product, such as its title, price, description, images, and other attributes.
  Dynamic Content Update:
  Once the data is successfully fetched, JavaScript dynamically updates the product details, images, and other relevant elements on the webpage.
  This dynamic updating ensures that the webpage displays the most current and accurate information to the user.
  Event Handling:
  Event listeners are added to various elements on the webpage to respond to user interactions.
  For example, a click event listener is attached to the "Add to Cart" button to handle the addition of items to the shopping cart.
  Another event listener is added to the small thumbnail images to update the main product image when clicked.
  Error Handling:
  The script includes error handling mechanisms to catch and handle any errors that may occur during the data fetching process.
  Error messages are logged to the console to aid in debugging and troubleshooting.

Summary:
  The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files work together synergistically to create a fully functional and visually appealing webpage.
  HTML provides the structure and content, CSS enhances the presentation and layout, and JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior.
  Together, these files enable the creation of a seamless user experience, allowing users to interact with and explore the product information presented on the webpage.
