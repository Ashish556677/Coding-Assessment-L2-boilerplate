## Getting Started

1Product Showcase Web Page
Overview
This project is a product showcase web page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a stylish and interactive interface for displaying product details, images, and options.

HTML (index.html)
The HTML file defines the structure and content of the web page. It includes elements such as product images, details, price, color options, size options, quantity input, and an "Add to Cart" button. Additionally, the product description is presented in a separate section below the product images.

CSS (style.css)
The CSS file provides the visual styling and layout for the web page. It defines the colors, fonts, spacing, positioning, and other visual aspects to ensure a cohesive and visually appealing user interface. The styling is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on various devices.

JavaScript (script.js)
The JavaScript file adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to the web page. It fetches product data from a JSON file, updates the product details based on the retrieved data, and enables features such as switching between product images on click, selecting color options, and adding items to the cart with quantity control. Additionally, it dynamically displays the added items in the cart section.
